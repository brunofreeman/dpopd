        * has to do with size: when environment is large, always works
TODO: sometimes, agents spawn in illegal areas

--Optimization--
TODO: const/const reference C++ optimizations
TODO: float vs. double (graphics should use float, but are doubles necessary for data?)

--Code Improvement--
TODO: refactor external SFM code
        * did they use degrees instead of radians? see orientation()
TODO: comments/documentation!

TODO: agent-agent and agent-wall collision
TODO: add a version of penta_in_hepta environment with some interior walls
