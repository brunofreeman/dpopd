--Bugs--
TODO: SFM/waypoints have trouble dealing with sharp corners
        * agents can get stuck when a waypoint pops
        * and the straight-line path to the next waypoint
        * is through a wall
TODO: if waypoint size to proximity ratio is too large
        * can pop two waypoints immediately
        * causes problems when going around two close corners
